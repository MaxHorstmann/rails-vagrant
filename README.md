rails-vagrant
=============

Vagrant configuration file to spin up VM with

* Ubuntu Server 14.04 (Trusty Tahr)
* Ruby 2.1.5 (installed via [RVM](https://rvm.io))
* Rails (latest stable - currentely 4.2)
* PostgreSQL 9.4

Only shell scripts are used for provisioning, no Chef/Puppet/... dependencies, so it should just work even under Windows.
